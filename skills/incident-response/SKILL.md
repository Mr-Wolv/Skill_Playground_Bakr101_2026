name: incident-response
description: Run an incident response workflow — triage, communicate, mitigate, and hand off into postmortem. Trigger with "we have an incident", "production is down", or an alert that needs severity assessment or status updates during active response.
argument-hint: "<incident description or alert>"

# /incident-response

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../../CONNECTORS.md).

Manage an active incident from detection through resolution, then hand off into the dedicated postmortem workflow.

## Usage

```
/incident-response $ARGUMENTS
```

## Modes

```
/incident-response new [description]     # Start a new incident
/incident-response update [status]       # Post a status update
/incident-response postmortem            # Assemble incident facts for handoff into postmortem
```

If no mode is specified, ask what phase the incident is in.

│  Phase 1: TRIAGE                                                  │
│  ✓ Assess severity (SEV1-4)                                     │
│  ✓ Identify affected systems and users                          │
│  ✓ Assign roles (IC, comms, responders)                         │
│                                                                    │
│  Phase 2: COMMUNICATE                                              │
│  ✓ Draft internal status update                                  │
│  ✓ Draft customer communication (if needed)                     │
│  ✓ Set up war room and cadence                                   │

## Severity Classification

| Level | Criteria | Response Time |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| SEV1 | Service down, all users affected | Immediate, all-hands |
| SEV2 | Major feature degraded, many users affected | Within 15 min |
| SEV3 | Minor feature issue, some users affected | Within 1 hour |
| SEV4 | Cosmetic or low-impact issue | Next business day |

## Communication Guidance

Provide clear, factual updates at regular cadence. Include: what's happening, who's affected, what we're doing, when the next update is.

## Output — Status Update

## If Connectors Available

If **~~monitoring** is connected:
- Pull alert details and metrics
- Show graphs of affected metrics

If **~~incident management** is connected:
- Create or update incident in PagerDuty/Opsgenie
- Page on-call responders

If **~~chat** is connected:
- Post status updates to incident channel
- Create war room channel

## Tips

1. **Start writing immediately** — Don't wait for complete information. Update as you learn more.
2. **Keep updates factual** — What we know, what we've done, what's next. No speculation.
3. **Postmortems are blameless** — Focus on systems and processes, not individuals.
4. **Use `postmortem` for the full writeup** — This skill should hand off facts and timeline rather than duplicating the whole postmortem workflow.
